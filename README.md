# Articles Classification and Clustering

Performed classification (SVM, Random Forrests, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest
Neighbor) and clustering (K-means) on news articles. Precision / Recall /
F-Measure, Accuracy, ROC plot metrics were used for the evaluation. PCA, SVD
and ICA methods were used for data visualization. News Articles can be found 
on 'fulltext' folder.

## create_files.py:
Reads articles from the 'fulltext' folder, splits them in train and test data and creates
the correspoding csv files.

## wordclouds.py:
Creates a wordcloud for each article category (business, entertain, politics,
sport, tech).

## classification.py:
Classification with SVM, Random Forrests, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest
Neighbor methods and evaluation.

## clustering.py:
Clustering with Kmeans method and visualization.
